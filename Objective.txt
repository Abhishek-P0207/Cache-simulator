Objective: Develop a Python simulator for cache mapping, designing a processor with a two-level cache system along with main memory.
DETAILS:

1. L1 cache

 (8kB) - direct map cache supported by victim cache.

 128 lines in L1 cache- size of each lie is 64 bytes (byte addressable memory)

 Victim cache supports L1 cache: 4 lines (fully associative cache)

2. L2 cache

 (16 kB) – 4-way set associative cache.

 256 lines in L2 cache.

3. Size of main memory is 64 kB.

Question:

Write a piece of code that rationally mimics the behaviour of a processer in issuing addresses to the memory.

(Objective of simulator– show how replacement in L1 and L2 memory works and show how element is transferred to L1 victim cache using required animation.)
